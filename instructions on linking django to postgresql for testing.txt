Prerequisites:
Download of PostgreSQL
Fresh download of Python version, stored in a new file called Python3.12.6
creation of a DB named "CollaBand_DB" in PostgreSQL

from the file sitting above the project, in our case it should be CS-Capstone-main,
run this code in the terminal:
& "C:\Program Files\Python3.12.6\python.exe" -m venv env
this should create a folder called env which should contain 'Scripts' within it

To activate the virtual environment use this code:
.\env\Scripts\activate
if you aren't able to activate try running the following lines:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
and then try again.

run the following lines:
pip install django

pip uninstall django-filters

pip install django-filter
pip install django djangorestframework
pip install psycopg2
pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
pip install gunicorn
pip install python-socketio
python -m pip install django-cors-headers

then navigate to CollaBand_Project using the cd command:
cd CollaBand_BackEnd
cd CollaBand_Project

after this go to the settings.p section within CollaBand_Project and within the DATABASES section change PASSWORD to your PostgreSQL password (the current one, "root" is Nathans password if you want to break into his PostgreSQL databases)

now you want to, within the terminal, use:
python manage.py makemigrations
and then:
python manage.py migrate

and boom! your Django and PostgreSQL database should be connected and the tables should have migrated. to check, wait a few moments, refresh your CollaBand_DB database in PostgreSQL and open the CollaBand_DB, then schemas, then tables. you should be able to see a bunch of tables where there were none before

potential errors:
if you get an error about manage not found you likely are in the wrong section and not properly within COllaBand_Project
make sure that your virtual environment env is active at all points in this process, if you come back to it and want to use env you must run env/scripts/activate
